                    <h1>5G The Future Connection</h1>
                    <p>Research by Barclays shows that 5G technology could add 17.5 million to the economy by 2025.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All major phone networking companies in UK involved plus other giants such as Apple are now investing into the technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Belfast is one of the only cities in the UK where 5G has been rolled out into however cover is limited now due it being early stages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as benefiting consumers 5G could also benefit businesses in big ways. Workers will be able to work remotely more easily, operate machinery from afar and be more “present” without being present, through capabilities like 4K, AR, VR and holographic calls. In turn they’ll be able to free up more time and be more productive, as less travel will be needed, and when travel is needed 5G could speed that up too, thanks to smart and automated transport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As noted above, 5G will enable network slicing too, which in turn will allow companies to essentially have their own private networks, tailored completely to their needs. And more jobs and processes can be automated with 5G, because it will have the speed, capacity and latency required, which will improve operational efficiency.5G could also better connect rural communities, opening more opportunities for businesses in these regions. 5G could even pave the way to whole new products and industries that aren’t viable with 4G. With all these benefits, 5G could create 22 million jobs, and lead to the production of up to $12.3 trillion (£9.3 trillion) of goods and services by 2035.
                    </p>

                    for no man and we don’t just plan to change the landscape we plan a revolution not seen in this
                    world in such a grand scale since the beginning of the digital revolution.

                    Our goal and aim is to challenge your thoughts, views and notions on what technology really is and
